Very basic program. Enter if you want to encrypt or decrypt if you encrypt the program asks for the message you wish to encrypt, creates a key and encrypts said message and outputs as cyphertext.txt and key.txt and a hash of the cyphertext as hash.txt
decrypt takes cyphertext.txt and key.txt and shall decrypt the cypher text and output plaintext.py if hash.txt matches the hash of cyphertext.txt
